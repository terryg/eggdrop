# Egg Drop
A Ruby script to determine the minimum number of drops for the worst case scenario of using a binary search to find the highest floor from which an egg survives a drop. In other words, a recursive function to calculate the height of a complete binary tree. Also equal to O(log n)!

```
Usage: eggdrop.rb (test|FLOORS)
       Assumes enough eggs to throw from each FLOOR.
```

```
$ ./eggdrop.rb 100000
Min. eggs for worst case of 0 to 100000 is 17
$
```
